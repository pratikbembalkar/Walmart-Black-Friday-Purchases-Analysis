# Walmart-Black-Friday-Purchases-Analysis
Project Overview

This project is a data science analysis based on a take-home assignment for a data science position at Walmart. The goal is to analyze customer purchase behavior during Walmartâ€™s Black Friday sales, with a focus on understanding gender-based spending patterns. Specifically, the analysis aims to determine whether women spend more than men during Black Friday sales, while also considering other demographic factors such as age, occupation, and city category.

The dataset used (walmart_data.csv) contains transactional data, including customer demographics, product categories, and purchase details. By analyzing this data, the project seeks to uncover meaningful insights that can guide business decisions related to customer engagement, marketing strategies, and inventory management.

This project demonstrates key data science skills, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization, providing actionable insights into consumer behavior during high-sales events like Black Friday.
